                     <p>The about us page is commonly used by all types of businesses to give customers more insight into who is involved with a given business and exactly what it does. The history of a business is often provided, and the histories of the people in charge are usually expressed through short articles, usually accompanied by photographs.

Depending on the specific company, some information about goals, attitude or other aspects of culture that aren't strictly tied to business practices are included as well. The about us page is often a reflection of the purpose and personality of the business and its owners or top employees. Finally, the page can also incorporate contact or locational information. One way to view the about us concept is as a text self-portrait or short autobiography created by a business.

                           <p>The primary purpose of an about us page is to inform the reader about the company and its operations. This is a straightforward goal that nearly all businesses have to fulfill in some fashion or another. However, there are other reasons why about us pages are common fixtures on business websites. The text on these pages is a marketing tool for a business, enticing potential customers with both the history and the aspirations of a business, as well as adding a human element. Additionally, about us pages are incorporated into search-engine marketing efforts as a way to find potential customers through Web searches.
                Ecommerce is a rapidly expanding segment of overall commerce, with more stores being opened each and every day. An about us page helps a business distinguish itself from the competition. This individualization is valuable for businesses that are using drop shipping or are otherwise selling products offered by other stores. Customers place a great deal of value on price, delivery options and customer service, but will also remember a store that has a more developed personality. The about us page helps online retailers develop a relationship with customers and build trust by putting a face and a story to the name on the storefront
